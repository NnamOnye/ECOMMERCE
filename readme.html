A simple fashion/designer website project template using (Html/Css/Javascript/Python) on the DJANGO FRAMEWORK...

ANYONE CAN USE THIS TEMPLATE TO FINISH/BUILD A WEBSITE...
Any corrections/updates are welcomed...

NOTE#1: WHEN YOU DEPLOY DJANGO FRAMEWORK YOU ALREADY HAVE A JS/CSS/HTML/PYTHON TEMPLATE !!! 

NOTE#2: I have ordered the directories in the repository to match the order of the directories in whichever editor you use so it will be easier to find the files

One more thing... i got this tip from the django readme.html doc... 
Before running this project, you may want to create a super user.

Synchronize the Database
This project has default settings for the database (it uses sqlite). If you need a super user, you'll need to create one before running the project.

Open Solution Explorer.
Right-click the project node and select Python->Django Create Superuser.


Enter account details when prompted. This creates a new account, and the details do not need to match any of your existing accounts.
