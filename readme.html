A personal fashion/designer website project using (Html/Css/Javascript/Python) on the DJANGO FRAMEWORK...

NOTE#1: WHEN YOU DEPLOY DJANGO FRAMEWORK YOU ALREADY HAVE A JS/CSS/HTML/PYTHON TEMPLATE !!! 

NOTE#2: I have ordered the directories in the repository to match the order of the directories in whichever editor you use so it will be easier to find the files

I myself am still working on completing this website to my perspective so lets get to CODING!



One more thing... i got this tip from the django readme.html doc... 
Before running this project, you may want to create a super user.

Synchronize the Database
This project has default settings for the database (it uses sqlite). If you need a super user, you'll need to create one before running the project.

Open Solution Explorer.
Right-click the project node and select Python->Django Create Superuser.


Enter account details when prompted. This creates a new account, and the details do not need to match any of your existing accounts.
